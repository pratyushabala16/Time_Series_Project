# Time Series and Forecasting Project


 We have worked on prediciting the future sales at Walmart based on heirarchical sales in the states of California, Texas, and Wisconsin. Forecasting sales, revenue, and stock prices is a classic application of machine learning in economics, and it is important because it allows investors to make guided decisions based on forecasts made by algorithms.

* In this project, we have briefly explained the structure of dataset.
* Then, we visualized the dataset using Matplotlib and Plotly and performed some EDA.
* We tested and subsequently estimated Trend, Seasonality components.
* And finally,we checked for randomness and accordingly built suitable models like moving average, exponential smoothing , ARMA and ARIMA model for further analysis and forecasting future sales and stock prices. Attached is the Actual vs Fitted Values given by the ARIMA(1,1,1) model.

# Time_Series_and_forecasting_project_MTH442A


 We will work on prediciting the future sales at Walmart based on heirarchical sales in the states of California, Texas, and Wisconsin. Forecasting sales, revenue, and stock prices is a classic application of machine learning in economics, and it is important because it allows investors to make guided decisions based on forecasts made by algorithms.

* In this project, we will briefly explain the structure of dataset.
* Then, we will visualize the dataset using Matplotlib and Plotly and perform some EDA.
* We will test and subsequently estimate Trend, Seasonality components.
* And finally,we will check for randomness and accordingly built suitable models like moving average, exponential smoothing , ARMA and ARIMA model for further analysis and forecasting future sales and stock prices.
